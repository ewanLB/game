# Game

This repository contains a small web‑based shooting game built with
JavaScript and HTML5 canvas. Open `index.html` in a browser to play.

Use the left and right arrow keys to move the player and press the space bar to
shoot at falling targets. Destroying enemies awards points which are displayed
on the canvas.

Press **Start** to begin a 60‑second round. The remaining time is shown next to
the controls. Press **End** or wait for the timer to reach zero to stop the
game.

## Random Picker Wheel

A simple random picker with a spinning wheel is also included. Open
`wheel.html` to add, remove and spin options. The list of options is stored in
`localStorage` so your choices are remembered across sessions.
